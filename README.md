##Geo-Located Data
Extracting Patterns from Mobile Data using Scikit-Learn and Cassandra

Learn how to extract patterns and detect anomalies within geo-located data, using machine learning clustering algorithms

In this tutorial, you’ll prototype a venue recommender and a geo-fencing alerting engine, using geo-located data and machine learning clustering algorithms, practicing the skills you need to build your own geo-located data applications.

You’ll see how geographical analyses enable a wide range of services, from location-based recommenders to advanced security systems, and you’ll learn how to package data-driven applications based on geographical data and expose these insights as (micro) services.

### What you’ll learn—and how you can apply it

By the end of this live, hands-on, online course, you’ll understand:

- Machine learning “K-Means” and “DBSCAN” clustering techniques
- How to cluster geo-located data
- How to detect patterns and anomalies
- How to use Cassandra as a datastore for events and models


### And you’ll be able to:

- Use Scikit-Learn for preparing and clustering geo-located data
- Prototype a basic venue recommender
- Prototype a basic geo-fencing alerting engine
- Load and extract geo-located data and models in Cassandra
- Build a data-driven microservice in Python
